 Project for a subject named "Java Programming" at Zagreb University of Applied Sciences.
 This project was worked on in late 2022 and early 2023.

 The theme of this project was of my own choosing, while there were some boxes that I had to tick.
 The theme of the project is a "roguelike game," but the implementation incorporates various technologies
 and tools such as databases, file IO, JavaFX, SceneBuilder, Maven, logback, and other Java language and
 IntelliJ IDEA-related features and technologies.

 The code itself isn't perfect. For example, there is an overuse of encapsulation for the purpose
 of practice and consistency; some tiny inconsistencies in writing style due to me finding out
 what worked the best for larger code bases; some missed spaces after commas; etc.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 To run the project, open the project through IntelliJ IDEA and let it take care of setting it up.

 Read the material inside the directory "for_initializing_h2_database".

 In the project, both a database and file I/O are utilized simultaneously. Consequently, the data is 
 stored in both the database and file system. As a result, it is necessary to manually create an 
 admin (or non-admin) in the code for both the database and file system, but only during the initial 
 run of the "empty" project.
 
 Additionally, it is crucial to load all the entity names from the file system into the database. 
 To accomplish this, please refer to the instructions provided in the "for_initializing_h2_database/methods.txt"
 file. It contains the necessary guidelines.

 This is all. There is a possibility that I may have forgotten to include something important in this description. 
 If that is the case, I do apologize.
