This file was created to prevent GitHub from deleting the "user_entities" directory.
Without it, the program will encounter an error as it won't find a designated location to store user game data.

While this directory is not essential when solely using the database, it is recommended to keep it intact.

IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOT TO LEAVE THIS DIRECTORY EMPTY OR DELETE IT!
