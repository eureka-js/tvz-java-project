This project uses files and the database simultaneously. If you want to use only the files, comment out all the
database lines in this project and disregard these methods apart from the "FileIO.registerUser()".

You can place those methods inside the overridden start method in "MainApplication". Start the application,
then exit the application. (Otherwise, you might forget to disable them.)
Afterward, you can either comment out or delete those lines of code in the "MainApplication" file.


This line of code is meant to be executed only once if the database is empty without any entity names:
    LoadNamesToDatabase.updateFromFileToDB();

This is used to add/create a user as an admin (not to change the role):
    try {
        Database.registerUser("user", LoginController.hashPassword("user1"), Enums.UserRole.ADMIN);
        FileIO.registerUser("admin", LoginController.hashPassword("admin1"), UserRole.ADMIN);
    }
    catch (SQLException | IOException e) {

    }
